Simply saying, this project is trying to investigate the relationship network between investors and startup companies. The data is from [notpeter/crunchbase-data](https://github.com/notpeter/crunchbase-data.git). The codes include the EDA on the industry and a random-walk-based predictive model which is trying to predict who will be the most likely investors for a given startup company. 

The *practiceData* folder has some tutorial of how to use R to implement network analysis.
